# Stage Gauge

The purpose of this service is to alleviate the issue of searching aimlessly for concerts you're free to attend nearby. I've found myself too often looking to individual venue websites or finding a show I'm interested in only to find out that it's an hour drive away.

StageGauge will display small music concerts in Chicago, i.e. "gauging" the "stages" in the area, by using a Python web scraper to gather real-time information and a React app for the user interface.

Start date of this project: 8 November 2023

## Progress

Beginning to web scrape from lh-st.com, Lincoln Hall and Schubas Tavern's joint website which displays all upcoming concerts at the two venues.

## Dependencies

python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4

## Could be helpful in the future
